<h2>Bio
</h2>
<p> I am Daoming Murong (慕容道明), also known as Daoye Murong (慕容道业), Shuren Murong (慕容叔仁), Emperor Chengwu of the Great Yan (大燕成武皇帝). Born into the noble Murong clan of the Xianbei (鲜卑) people, I have dedicated my life to the unification and prosperity of our fractured lands during the tumultuous period of the Sixteen Kingdoms. As a seasoned general and strategist, I have led armies to numerous victories, overcoming great adversity. After serving under Former Yan and witnessing its decline, I established the New Yan Kingdom to restore order and stability.
</p>
